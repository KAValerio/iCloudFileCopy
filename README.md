# iCloudFileCopy
Quick little script to back files up into iCloud Drive. 
I was already paying for iCloud drive storage and wanted to use this to backup my documents. I couldn't find an easy way to automatically back PC documents to iCloud so I made my own script to automate this for me.

# To Use
 - Replace the "FROMPATH" with the original sourse of the files
 - Replace "TOPATH" to the directory in iCloud Drive
 - Copy and paste the line for as many directories as you want
 - Run the script whenever you want a backup
